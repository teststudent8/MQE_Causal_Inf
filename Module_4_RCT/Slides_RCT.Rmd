## Module 4: Randomized Control Trials


## The Experimental Ideal:

Getting causal effects is HARD! 


## The Experimental Ideal:

Getting causal effects is HARD! 


So where do we go from here? 

Randomized control trials (RCT's) aka the "Gold standard" of experimental designs



## Random assignment and the selection problem

The idea: use random assignment remove selection bias

Suppose a constant treatment effect: $Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)=\tau$, a constant. For observation $i$ we have that


$$
\begin{split}
Y_i &=Y_i(0)+\tau D_i\\
Y_i &=E[Y_i(0)]+\tau D_i+Y_i(0)-E[Y_i(0)]\\
Y_i &=\alpha+\tau D_i+\eta_i
\end{split}
$$

where $\alpha=E[Y_i(0)]$, $\tau=Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)$, and $\eta_i$ is the random part of $Y_i(0)$ since $\eta_i=Y_i(0)-E[Y_i(0)]$. 

## Random assignment and the selection problem

The expected outcomes for someone with treatment $(D_i=1)$, and without treatment $(D_i=0)$ are given by



$$
\begin{split}
E[Y_i(1)] &=\alpha +\tau +E[\eta_i|D_i=1]\\
E[Y_i(0)] &=\alpha +E[\eta_i|D_i=0]\\
\end{split}
$$
so that we can break down the difference between these outcomes as
$$
E[Y_i(1)]-E[Y_i(0)] = 
    \underbrace{\tau}_\text{treatment effect} + \underbrace{E[\eta_i|D_i=1]-E[\eta_i|D_i=0]}_\text{selection bias}.
$$ 

## Random assignment and the selection problem

Selection bias will bias our estimate of $\tau$ if those who select into treatment have a different expected outcome compared to those who do not select into treatment:
$$
E[Y_i(0)|D_i=1]\neq E[Y_i(0)|D_i=0].
$$ 

This is because treatment is not random:  $\{Y_i(1), Y_i(0)\}\not\perp  D_i$. 

There is no reason to believe that those who select into treatment have the same expected outcome as those who do not, if they were to be treated, that is to say, it is possible (and even likely) that  

$$
\underbrace{E[Y_i(0)|D_i=0]}_\text{observed}\neq  \underbrace{E[Y_i(0)|D_i=1]}_\text{unobserved}\neq E[Y_i(0)]
$$


## Random assignment and the selection problem

The conditional independence assumption allows us to control for selection bias by conditioning on **observed characteristics**...

...  **unobserved characteristics** that we cannot control for will often also bias our estimates. 

Random assignment solves all of these selection bias problems.

## Random assignment and the selection problem


Random assignment makes $D_i$ independent of potential outcomes: 

$$
\{Y_i(1), Y_i(0)\}\perp  D_i.
$$


With random assignment, we know that in expectiation, 

$$
\underbrace{E[Y_i(0)|D_i=0]}_\text{observed}=  \underbrace{E[Y_i(0)|D_i=1]}_\text{unobserved}= E[Y_i(0)]
$$
\begin{center}
and
\end{center}
$$
\underbrace{E[Y_i(1)|D_i=0]}_\text{unobserved}= \underbrace{E[Y_i(1)|D_i=1]}_\text{observed}= E[Y_i(1)]
$$

## Random assignment and the selection problem

Thus, the causal **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)**, $\bar{\tau}$, is  
\footnotesize
$$
\begin{aligned}
\bar{\tau}&=E[Y_i(1)]-E[Y_i(0)]=\underbrace{E[Y_i(1)|D_i=1]}_\text{observed}-\underbrace{E[Y_i(0)|D_i=0]}_\text{observed}\\
&=E[Y_i|D_i=1]-E[Y_i|D_i=0].
\end{aligned}
$$
\normalsize

and we can easily estimate  $\bar{\tau}$, by taking the difference between the average value of $Y_i$ in the treatment group and the average value of $Y_i$ in the control group. 

## RCT estimation

RCT regressions are about as straigtforward as it gets.

As modeled above, you can estimate 

$$
Y_i=\alpha+\tau D_i+\eta_i
$$

where $\alpha=E[Y_i(0)]$, $\tau=Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)$, and $\eta_i$ is the random error term.


## RCT estimation

The treatment effect will be given by 
$$
E[Y_i(1)]-E[Y_i(0)] = 
    \underbrace{\tau}_\text{treatment effect} + \underbrace{E[\eta_i|D_i=1]-E[\eta_i|D_i=0]}_\text{selection bias}.
$$
With proper randomizating,

$$
E[\eta_i|D_i=1]= E[\eta_i|D_i=0]
$$ 
so there is no selection bias giving us an unbiased estimate of $\tau$. 

## RCT Simulation

I am a principal of a large school and I want to evaluate how access to small reading groups with a paraprofessional helps improve 4th grade test scores.

I take all the 4th graders and randomly assign 30 percent of them to treatment (participating in the reading groups) with therest to the control group which continued with class as normal. 

## RCT Simulation

I generate a set of simualted data: 
\tiny
```{r simrct1, results = "asis", echo=TRUE}

set.seed(1999)

scores5<-as.data.frame(rep(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10),times=30))
names(scores5)<-c("class")
scores5 <- fastDummies::dummy_cols(scores5, select_columns = "class")
scores5$error<-rnorm(300, mean=0, sd=10)

#treatment indicator
scores5$treat<-rbinom(300,1,0.3)

#mean reading score
alpha=75

#treatment effect
tau=10

#the data generating process: notice the class does affect a student's score
scores5$read4<-alpha+tau*scores5$treat+scores5$error+4*scores5$class_1+(-6)*scores5$class_2+8*scores5$class_3+(-4)*scores5$class_4+7*scores5$class_5+(-2)*scores5$class_6+5*scores5$class_7+(-10)*scores5$class_8+8*scores5$class_9+4*scores5$class_10
```

## RCT Simulation

\tiny
```{r simrct1a, results = "asis", echo=TRUE}
rct1<-felm(read4~treat,scores5)
stargazer(rct1, type="latex", header=FALSE)
```

\normalsize
Because treatment was randomized, even though the class the student is in does affect their score,  we recover an unbiased estimate of the true treatment effect ($\tau=10$).


## RCT Key assumption

The key assumption is that 
$$
E[\eta_i|D_i=1]= E[\eta_i|D_i=0]=0.
$$
 
 
- we cannot test this assumption directly

- BUT we can  do a **balance test**: we check to see if observable characteristics among treatment and control groups are the same on average.

## RCT Balance tests

- can be presented as a table of the following regressions $X_i=\beta_0+\beta_1D_i+\epsilon_i$ where $X_i$ is a vector of characteristics being tested. 
 
- are often presented as simple t-test tables testing the difference in means between the treatment and control groups.
 



## RCT Balance Tests

Balance test variables should be 

- characteristics at baseline, prior to treatment,

- or characteristics that would be unaffected by treatment.

Balance tests are often run on many variables: 

- some may come up with a statistically significant difference by simple random chance 

- if many are significantly different, this is a red flag that the key assumption does not hold 

- There are corrections that can be implemented if the unbalanced variables are are of particular concern (look up Bonferroni correction)   

## RCT Simulation


Suppose the principal is concerned that there were some problems with the randomization.

She has access to some additional data. She adds it to her data set and does a balance test. 


## RCT Simulation
\tiny
```{r simrct2, echo=TRUE}

#simulating covariates

#third grade test scores. Notice I am generateing simulated academic scores that have a correlation to their "untreated" performance in 4th grade reading
scores5$read3<-alpha+scores5$error+rnorm(300,3,2)
scores5$math3<-alpha+scores5$error+rnorm(300,15,2)
scores5$hist3<-alpha+scores5$error+rnorm(300,5,2)
scores5$pe3<-rnorm(300,90,2)

#other 4th grade test scores: notice I am generating scores that correlated with their subject performance in 3rd grade. Also, the treatment is affecting other 4th grade academic scores
scores5$hist4<-4*scores5$treat+scores5$hist3+rnorm(300,-2,2)
scores5$pe4<-scores5$pe3+rnorm(300,0,5)
scores5$math4<-2*scores5$treat+scores5$math3+rnorm(300,-5,3)

#student characteristics
scores5$female<-rbinom(300,1,0.5)
scores5$age<-runif(300,9,10)
scores5$height<-rnorm(300,1.3,0.2)

scoresmini<-scores5[,c("treat", "read4", "read3", "math3","hist3","pe3","hist4","pe4","math4","female", "age", "height")]
knitr::kable(head(scoresmini))
```

## RCT Simulation
\tiny
```{r simrct2a, echo=TRUE}
#as you can see, we have simulated some complex interrelationships between theses variables.
cor(scoresmini)
```

## RCT Simulation
\tiny
```{r simrct2b, echo=TRUE}

namevec<-names(scores5)
#selecting variables to test
namevec<-namevec[!namevec%in%c("class","error", "treat","read4")]

#generating the syntax that will go in the lm function with a loop
allModelsList <- lapply(paste(namevec,"~treat"), as.formula)

#running all of the balance tests with a loop
allModelsResults <- lapply(allModelsList, function(x) lm(x, scores5))  
```

Some of the variables you included in the balance test are problematic. Which ones?

## RCT Simulation

Our data seems reasonably balanced:

- a few come out as statistically significant: class_6 and class_10 at 10\%, 

- pe_3 at 5\%.

This is the result of random chance as discussed above (we know this for certain since we modeled the data). 

If you had not modeled the data, would you be concerned? 

## RCT Simulation

- pe_3:

  - was determined prior to treatment
  
  - is not generally a variable we would expect to correlated with reading scores

  - should reassure you that it is the result of random chance.

- Class_6 and Class_10 would be more concerning:

  - it might signal that some teachers were better able to get their students into the small groups 
  - but the coefficients are not large, nor are they highly significant 
  
  - should reassure you that they are the result of random chance.
